 * @output_otp: output buffer, must have room for the output OTP plus zero
 *
 * Generate a one-time-password using the HOTP algorithm as described

 *
 * Use a value of %OATH_HOTP_DYNAMIC_TRUNCATION for @truncation_offset
 * unless you really need a specific truncation offset.
 *
 * To find out the size of the OTP you may use the OATH_HOTP_LENGTH()

 * Returns: On success, %OATH_OK (zero) is returned, otherwise an
 *   error code is returned.

/**
 * oath_hotp_validate_callback:
 * @secret: the shared secret string
 * @secret_length: length of @secret
 * @start_moving_factor: start counter in OTP stream
 * @window: how many OTPs after start counter to test
 * @digits: number of requested digits in the OTP
 * @strcmp_otp: function pointer to a strcmp-like function.
 * @strcmp_handle: caller handle to be passed on to @strcmp_otp.
 *
 * Validate an OTP according to OATH HOTP algorithm per RFC 4226.
 *
 * Validation is implemented by generating a number of potential OTPs
 * and performing a call to the @strcmp_otp function, to compare the
 * potential OTP against the given @otp.  It has the following
 * prototype:
 *
 * int (*oath_validate_strcmp_function) (void *handle, const char *test_otp);
 *
 * The function should be similar to strcmp in that it return 0 only
 * on matches.  It differs by permitting use of negative return codes
 * as indication of internal failures in the callback.  Positive
 * values indicate OTP mismatch.
 *
 * This callback interface is useful when you cannot compare OTPs
 * directly using normal strcmp, but instead for example only have a
 * hashed OTP.  You would then typically pass in the hashed OTP in the
 * @strcmp_handle and let your implementation of @strcmp_otp hash the
 * test_otp OTP using the same hash, and then compare the results.
 *
 * Currently only OTP lengths of 6, 7 or 8 digits are supported.  This
 * restrictions may be lifted in future versions, although some
 * limitations are inherent in the protocol.
 *
 * Returns: Returns position in OTP window (zero is first position),
 *   or %OATH_INVALID_OTP if no OTP was found in OTP window, or an
 *   error code.
 *
 * Since: 1.4.0
