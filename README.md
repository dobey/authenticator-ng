Authenticator
=============

This is a fork of the former [authenticator](https://launchpad.net/authenticator) app made for the Ubuntu phone platform, by Michael Zanetti.

Authenticator is an application that can be used for the two-factor
authentication for OATH compliant services. It currently supports both
HOTP (counter) and TOTP (timer) methods of one time password generation.
