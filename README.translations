# Updating translations

Translations for the Tagger app happen in [Launchpad Translations][] and
are automatically committed daily on the trunk branch in the po/ folder.

They are then built and installed as part of the package build, so that
developers don't really need to worry about them.

However, there is one task that needs to be taken care of: exposing new
translatable messages to translators. So whenever you add new translatable
messages in the code, make sure to follow these steps:

 1. Run click-buddy, or alternatively, cmake & make directly:
    `click-buddy --dir .`
 2. Commit and push the branch and send a merge proposal as usual

And that's it, once the branch lands Launchpad should take care of all the rest!

# Behind the scenes

Behind the scenes, whenever the po/*.pot file (also known as translations template)
is committed to trunk Launchpad reads it and updates the translatable strings
exposed in the web UI. This will enable translators to work on the new strings.
The translations template contains all translatable strings that have been
extracted from the source code files.

Launchpad will then store translations in its database and will commit them daily
in the form of textual po/*.po files to trunk. The PO files are also usually
referred to as the translations files. You'll find a translation file for each
language the app has got at least a translated message available for.

Translations for core apps follow the standard [gettext format][].
